   - Caution: Movements that stretch the hip extensively, like certain yoga poses or Pilates exercises.

4. Spinal Injuries:

Remember, the exact exercises to avoid will depend on the severity and location of the injury, as well as the individual's overall fitness level and health. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional or physical therapist to get personalized recommendations and ensure safe and effective rehabilitation.
