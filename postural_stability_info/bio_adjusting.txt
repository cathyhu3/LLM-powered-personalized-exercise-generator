Postural stability, often referred to as postural control, is the ability to maintain an upright posture in both static (e.g., standing) and dynamic (e.g., walking) situations.

1. Age:
    - With an increase in age, there is a natural decline in postural stability due to decrease in muscle strength, cognitive decline, and other degenerating changes.
   - Therefore, people who are older than average should avoid any activities that put a lot of stress on any parts of the body, such as pistol squats (puts too much stress on the knees)

2. Height:
    - Center of Gravity: Taller individuals have a higher center of gravity, which can make it more challenging to maintain postural stability, especially when the base of support is compromised.

3. Obesity:
    - Shifted Center of Mass: Obesity can shift the body's center of mass forward, affecting postural alignment.
    - Quicker Fatigue: Obesity means that there is more weight for postural muscles to support, which can lead to quicker fatigue.
    - Reduced Mobility: Excess body fat can limit the range of motion, particularly in the spine, hips, and knees, affecting postural adjustments.

4. Q Angle (Quadriceps Angle):
    - Pelvic and Hip Alignment: Decreased postural alignment.
    - Knee Stability: A larger Q angle can decrease knee stability, which is essential for maintaining an upright posture, especially during dynamic tasks.
    - Biomechanical Chain: The Q angle can influence the biomechanical chain from the feet up to the spine. Misalignments in the lower limb can propagate upwards, affecting overall postural stability.

Because of these factors, when starting an exercise program for postural stability, one must go at a pace and intensity that challenges them, but also allows for gradual and safe exposure to the exercises. Remember to take out exercises that may be too strenuous depending on their biometric classifications.
